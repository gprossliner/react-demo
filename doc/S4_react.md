# Steps performed

## Class vs. functional Components

* for "pure rendering" components (that just have a "render" function), it is not nesserary to define a class.
They can be definied just as a (lamda) function. See HelloLabel.tsx

* passing strong typed (!!!) state as props
Props is read-only state in react. It's like attributes in html tags.
We'll start with a greeting in HelloLabel.tsx

* try to refactor from "name" to "text"!!!
