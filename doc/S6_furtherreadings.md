# Manage state centrally with flux
With plain react, each component manages it's own state. This may be confusing in a bigger application.

"It's more of a pattern rather than a formal framework, and you can start using Flux immediately without a lot of new code."

# React router
Enables the whole route management, like static URLs (with Hash or Browser-History), or extraction of parameters (/customers/1234)

# Server Side Rendering
The virtual DOM can be rendered on the server, so that the initial Request is ways faster. Also works with router.
It even works with .js disables on the client (like robots).

# Keeping immutable state
This enables historic debugging

# React native

Allows platform native apps to be devloped with react.
This is not (!!!) a "Webpage-App", it's really the native UI implementation!
